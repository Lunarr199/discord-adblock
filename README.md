## ‚ùì Installation Guide

1. You need a client mod (Like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) or [Vencord (Recommended)](https://vencord.dev))

- **BetterDiscord:**
Open the CustomCSS Tab in the user settings
- **Vencord:**
Open settings, choose "Vencord", then "Edit QuickCSS"

2. Copy & Paste this CSS into the Custom CSS input *(This will load adblock.css from here, this mean that it will auto-update from this repo)*

For main adblock:
```css
@import url("https://croissantdunord.github.io/discord-adblock/adblock.css");
```
- (Optional) For **ALL** the extras, add this as well on a new line:

```
